1. **Safe Area**: An area deemed safe from a groundwater resources perspective based on assessments by CGWB and State groundwater organizations.

2. **Semi-Critical Area**: An area categorized as semi-critical in terms of groundwater resources based on assessments by CGWB and State groundwater organizations.

3. **Critical Area**: An area categorized as critical in terms of groundwater resources based on assessments by CGWB and State groundwater organizations.

4. **Over-Exploited Area**: An area categorized as over-exploited in terms of groundwater resources based on assessments by CGWB and State groundwater organizations.

5. **Aquifer**: A geological formation capable of storing and transmitting groundwater.

6. **Deeper Aquifer**: In areas with multiple aquifer systems, the aquifer(s) occurring below the uppermost aquifer.
